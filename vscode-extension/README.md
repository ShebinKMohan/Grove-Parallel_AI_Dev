# Grove — Worktree Control for Claude Code

> Orchestrate multiple Claude Code agents across git worktrees from one IDE sidebar.

Built for developers who use [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) and want to run multiple agents in parallel without the manual worktree juggling, file conflicts, and merge nightmares.

<!-- ![Grove in action](media/grove-demo.gif) -->

## What It Does

- **One-click agent teams** — pick a template (Full-Stack, Code Review, Debug Squad, Migration, Rapid Prototype), enter your task, and Grove creates isolated worktrees, generates per-agent CLAUDE.md files with enforced ownership boundaries, and launches all sessions in parallel
- **Base branch selection** — choose which branch to create worktrees from, with all local branches listed (default base branch first)
- **Inline file browsing** — expand any worktree in the sidebar to see changed files with git status icons (added/modified/deleted/renamed). Click a modified file to open an inline diff view against the base branch
- **Smart sync indicator** — the sync button only appears on worktrees that are behind the remote, so you know at a glance which branches need pulling
- **Real-time overlap detection** — file watchers monitor every worktree and alert you the moment two agents touch the same file, ranked by severity (conflict / warning / info)
- **Merge intelligence** — auto-commits tracked changes, captures a recovery hash, and walks you through sequential merges with conflict resolution, test gates, and abort safety
- **Live dashboard** — WebView panel with two-column session cards, directory-grouped file activity with clickable diffs, and overlap alerts. Teams persist across restarts
- **Worktree management** — create, monitor, sync, diff, and clean up worktrees without leaving your editor
- **User-friendly errors** — every error includes what went wrong and how to fix it. No raw git output or cryptic stack traces

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85+ or Cursor
- Git installed and in your PATH
- [Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com) (`claude` command in your PATH)

## Install

Search **"Grove"** in the Extensions panel, or:
```bash
code --install-extension ShebinMohanK.grove-pilot
```

## Quick Start

1. Open a git repo in VS Code or Cursor
2. Click the Grove icon in the Activity Bar
3. Hit **+** to create a worktree — pick a base branch, then name your new branch
4. Click the rocket icon to launch Claude Code in the worktree
5. Expand the worktree to see changed files and inline diffs
6. Launch an agent team with the team icon for parallel development
7. Open the dashboard (`Grove: Open Dashboard`) to monitor in real-time
8. When agents finish, generate a merge report and execute the guided merge sequence
